  const RULES = `PROPOSAL FORMULA (use this order)
1. Hook: the first line. 4 to 10 words. A bold statement about the risk or hidden opportunity in his situation. Curious or a little uneasy, never rude. "(with respect)" is fine when it is blunt. If the job post says the proposal must start with a certain word, start the hook with that word.
2. Greeting: "Hi {first name}," then say I saw his job post and restate his need in his own words. "Hi there" when there is no name.
3. Insider line (only if true): one sentence that shows I have done this before. Use only my profile and samples.
4. What I noticed: one or two specific things about his site or profile (from the audit or my notes), or one sharp insight about his situation.
5. Questions: 2 or 3, numbered, easy to answer, that qualify him (website age, what Search Console shows, where he ranks now, access, documents).
6. Close: one short casual line inviting a quick discussion.
7. Sign-off: a short role title tied to the hook (GBP Expert, Gem Finder, Your Optimizer), then my name.
8. P.S.: one line that backs up the hook with a fact or a consequence.

STYLE
- 70 to 130 words in total. Plain words, short lines, a little attitude.
- Never invent numbers like "3 times more calls" or "50% more traffic". Use a number only if it was measured on his site or I can name the source.
- Never say a report or sample is attached unless my profile lists one.
- Answer anything the job post asks for: price, timeline, examples, a starting word.
- Never promise rankings, reinstatement or review removal.
- No filler: "I am excited", "I came across", "I would love to", "message me right now".`;

  const AVOID = `- Invented statistics in the P.S. or the body (3 times more calls, 5 to 9% more revenue, 50% more traffic, 7 times more clicks).
- Sign-offs that are just a number ("Your 7 times more", "Your at least 50%").
- Saying "report attached" or "I worked on a similar project" with nothing to show.
- Pushy closes like "message me right now".
- Half-written or copy-pasted lines, typos, and the same P.S. on different jobs.
- Generic openers that could fit any job.`;

Hey Jay, you need to audit and optimize the website. I just went through it and it loads like a wooden wheel. It takes at least 3.6 seconds to load. The meta tags, headings, structure, AI optimization and keyword focus are missing.
